    <h2 class="title">About me</h2>

    <h1>
      I grew up in Western Canada in the lovely city of Calgary before moving out East to begin my degree in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am now on a mission to travel far and wide to make an impact through entrepreneurship and multi-disciplined design. I would like to bring about change, create delightful customer experiences, and ship products with industry leading tech through my internship opportunities and personal projects.
    </h1>
    <h1>
      I love to tinker, code, model, prototype, and just about any other design buzzword you can think of when I find a problem space that I can’t help but fall in love with. Projects at the intersection of humans and technology are my passion area. I am delighted to immerse myself in industrial design, electro-mechanical design, hardware design, and write eloquent code to bring a full packaged product to customers. I strongly believe in maintaining a design thinking mindset throughout the design process, from the first lingering thoughts to product launch.
    </h1>
    <h1>
      Oh yeah, and I love everything about the outdoors, just about every sport, and enjoying the finer things in life (i.e. a quality espresso, a perfect sunset beach, a gorgeous car). Catch me running on top of mountains, biking through valleys, or hanging out at a local hockey rink. I’m always looking for partners in crime; to scrimmage, scheme, or even launch a business with so don’t be afraid to say hi! P.S. it’s the green button.
